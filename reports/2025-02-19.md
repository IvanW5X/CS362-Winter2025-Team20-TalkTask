# Week 7 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* We've managed to make good progress this week. Backend development is nearly complete and just needs tests and fine details for communicating with our frontend server. Before we can communicate with the frontend, we still need to finish up our UI and make API calls to our backend services. More components are being added incrementally and the webpage is starting to look more like our Figma designs we created. We will first complete the desktop version of TalkTask and once we are satisfied with an MVP, we will begin to adjust the UI to be responsive with smaller smaller pixel sizes.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Add tests via the Jest framework for unit, validation, integration, and system components.
* Finish our frontend components to be ready for an MVP.
* Add user account creations to test system wide functionality.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement add and remove functionality using WebSpeechAPI.


### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Start researching OAuth and and how to integrate it to our project.
* Look into GitHub Actions and begin setting up CI/CD pipelines.

#### Progress & Issues

* I've successfully implemented our CI pipeline through GitHub actions and added dev dependencies for testing tools like ESLint and Jest, so that we can add testing to development. This task took longer than expected so, I was not able to get a chance to take a look at OAuth, but since we've got more people on this task, I'm not completely behind. I've also started to look into what specific tests I will add to our testing directories and will create some mock-data JSON files. Our CD pipeline won't need to be implemented manually since our web service hosting platforms offer that service in the configurate deployment sections of their websites.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Create tests and mock-data JSON files to simulate full usage of TalkTask
* Look into front and backend communication via API calls
