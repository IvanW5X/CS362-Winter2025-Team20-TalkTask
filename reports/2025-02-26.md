# Week 8 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* We made a lot progress on the app especially with authentication, displaying individual todo lists and the deployment of frontend and backend. The frontend is nearly done with some missing functionalities but the basic application is finished. The task managment components are complete with the exception of filtering/sorting tasks. The implementation of the calendar to view tasks by the day was started. The voice input is complete with some minor bugs in capturing what the title is. We also an made an about page for signup and login that users use. Main issues this week were deployment of the website. Frontend and backend deployment was fine individually but there were some issues connecting the two. In the end we were able to connect them.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Finish task managment components.
* Implement proper categorical views.
* Refactor code for responsiveness.


## Individual Contributions

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Implement all voice functionalities.
* Implement all CRUD functionalities.
* Implement "Task Management" component.

#### Progress & Issues

* I implemented all of the CRUD functionalities this week. I also implemented the voice feature. Add task, marking a task, and removing marked tasks is now completed. The voice feature for CRUD works for marking tasks and removing marked tasks. Adding also works but there are some minor bugs. Sometimes it doesn't capture the title correct and includes some of the placeholder words like "with description ____" into the title. I also created the task managment component and connect it all to the CRUD operations. I also added a reorder function that orders task with higher priority first. I also fixed the time displaying on the task card, it now displays proper local time instead of "NaN...". For the most part the frontend functionlities are good to go. Simple todo list functions are working and the voice feature is also working, aside from a bug with adding. All task operations are connected with the backend database.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement sort/filter tasks.
* Fix voice add bug.
* Finish task view by date if its not finished.

### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Create tests and mock-data JSON files to simulate full usage of TalkTask
* Look into front and backend communication via API calls

#### Progress & Issues

* Week 8 was all about progress. We were super behind on our project, so I decided to try and progress as much as possible. I made a lot of progress starting with updating packages for client server communication using axios and react-query. After the setup, i refactored a lot of the UI components to be more responsive and made them look like the actual Figma design we created, implemented authentication using an Auth0 context after Tristan did the initial Auth0 setup, created a responsive about page for user signups/logins with the functionality, and created a mock task json file that was used for testing client-server communication using react-query. I also managed to deploy our website using Netlify and Render, but only got the Auth0 login and home page functionality after the beta testing activity. Now that I have a good feel of the specific details and JavaScript, I will then work on refactoring all the code in the frontend to separate the hooks and services and implementing the rest of the project. I came across a lot of issues with authorization as I made our URIs protected and user states. Refactoring the code also was a big issue as I had to redo most of the CSS and move the components around.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Communicate with Kai (Database Developer) to create a user linked category schema that has an array of Task objects.
* Refactor the frontend components with the hooks and services directories.
* Implement categorical task views once the category schema is created.
  * Once created, I'll also refactor all of the Task components accordingly.
