#### Progress & Issues

* Week 8 was all about progress. We were super behind on our project, so I decided to try and progress as much as possible. I made a lot of progress starting with updating packages for client server communication using axios and react-query. After the setup, i refactored a lot of the UI components to be more responsive and made them look like the actual Figma design we created, implemented authentication using an Auth0 context after Tristan did the initial Auth0 setup, created a responsive about page for user signups/logins with the functionality, and created a mock task json file that was used for testing client-server communication using react-query. I also managed to deploy our website using Netlify and Render, but only got the Auth0 login and home page functionality after the beta testing activity. Now that I have a good feel of the specific details and JavaScript, I will then work on refactoring all the code in the frontend to separate the hooks and services and implementing the rest of the project. I came across a lot of issues with authorization as I made our URIs protected and user states. Refactoring the code also was a big issue as I had to redo most of the CSS and move the components around.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Communicate with Kai (Database Developer) to create a user linked category schema that has an array of Task objects.
* Refactor the frontend components with the hooks and services directories.
* Implement categorical task views once the category schema is created.
  * Once created, I'll also refactor all of the Task components accordingly.
