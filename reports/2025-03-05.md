# Week 9 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* We were able to compelete the remaiing missing functionalities. We encountered some bugs during the week that were also fixed which included adding a task to the wrong date. We were able to deploy the frontend and backend but with some minor bugs. Although the bug is fixed locally, the bug that adds the task to the wrong date is persistent. This will be fixed before presentation. Our poster has also been made and an order has been submitted for print.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Fix bugs in deployed product.
* Maintain deployed product.
* Present project.

#### Progress & Issues

* I was able to implement some of the remaining functionalities that were missing with Ivan. That includes the filter/sort function, suggest task, and day based task management. I also fixed some minor bugs including tasks being added to the wrong day and the voice speech API not capturing some of the speech. We were able to deploy it with a minor bugs that should be fixed before we present. I also did some minor changes on the poster since we were using the wrong size originally but I was able to fix it and submit an order to print.
