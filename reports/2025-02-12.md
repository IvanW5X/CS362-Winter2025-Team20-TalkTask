# Week 6 Project Report

## Team Report

### Progress & Issues

* Progress for our project is moving steadily. Our frontend developers have added the Navbar component and started implementing the sidebar that holds the tasks lists and the task section itself. Our backend files have been refatored to follow MVC architecture more accurately, packages have been updated, and most of our teammates now have access to the database as an admin. As far as the speech recognition functionality, it can now parse and process commands to the main task management functions like add, remove, and mark tasks. These functions now just need to be linked to the database once we test them and ensure that they are working as intended. Our suggest task functionality is nearly complete and has been switched to using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flah model with the free API plan, so that we can avoid training an AI model and focus on testing and producing a working product. Various TalkTask logos have been created for both complete and simpler versions, so that they have different dimensions and can be placed where we see fit.

### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* The frontends main goal is to start working with the database to be able to store info primarily for tasks as well bringing the overall main pages ui to look as similar to the figma as possible with minor changes as needed.
* For backend I plan to implement more functionalities using voice input now that I have a good string parsing function.
* Get started on implementing and connecting OAuth to the database to store new users.


## Individual Contributions

### Raymond Cen

#### Goals

* Implement add and remove functionality using WebSpeechAPI.

#### Progress & Issues

* I've successfully implemented add and remove functionality. But the functions used for add and remove are just placeholders until I connect it to the task controller and its functions. I was getting behind mainly because parsing a string in JavaScript when its provided by a voice input. The method they used was using regular expressions which, in code, I've never seen before. But now that I've added it, I can use it for all the other functionalities. Adding the other commands to the "grammar" of the web speech API will take a little longer because I want variation when saying those commands.
#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Implement priority and date when adding task. 
* Get started on sorting tasks using voice input.


### Ivan Wong

#### Goals

* Switch to the transformers library, replacing the inference library to fine-tune my choice of AI model for our use case.
* Refactor current backend source files to an even higher level of abstraction using the controllers concept.
* Start researching OAuth and how to itegrate it to our project.

#### Progress & Issues

* For our AI functionality, I came across a lot of issues with the AI models provided by Hugging Face. Most of of the models I used either needed to be trained using Python or were not producing logical outputs based on a list of tasks. To resolve this issue, I decided to look into other free AI models and tested various models with different prompts and found Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model produced exactly what we needed for our use case and was fairly simple to setup, since the documentation provided example code.
* For refactoring our backend files, I managed to seperate our logic even further and edited current code to follow the MVC architecture that we mentioned before in both our living doc. Specifically, I moved the code in the services files in the backend to the controller files because it was more fitting and handles the HTTP logic and API end routes. I also refactored the code in our index.js file to be responsible for connecting the database and our server.js file to use the controller routes.
* For OAuth, the AI functionality took up most of time relative to what I allocate for this course, so I wasn't able to research how to implement OAuth into our project.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Start researching OAuth and and how to integrate it to our project.
* Look into GitHub Actions and begin setting up CI/CD pipelines.

### Bailey Budlong

#### Goals

* Help implement designs with other front-end developers
* Create Figma designs for sub-UI elements (task creation menu, profile, etc)

#### Progress & Issues

* Favicon created
* Haven't made much progress this past week. I need to check in with frontend team to see where I can be most helpful, likely implementing the static pages.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Work on implementing static pages
* Commit Figma designs to repo

### Jordan Cowan

#### Goals

* My plans for next week are to get the tasks portion working along with looking like a task as shown in the ui/ux designers draft of our app.
* On top of this I will be adding the "If there are particular assumptions underpinning your chosen architecture, identify and describe them." section of the living doc as to be inline with the project architecture and design assignment.

#### Progress & Issues

* I ran into some issues with trying to get added as an admin to the mongodb database causing a delay on working on functionality for the tasks 
* I got the design looking mostly like the figma design minus some sizing differences that will be worked out once every component is able to be put together properly and some styling that will be easier to work on when I can add some functionality.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* My goal for Next week is to have properly completed the add, update, and delete functionality to the tasks buttons.
* I would also like to make it so that the dates in the calendar section above tasks can be cycled through to show multiple dates and not just a static set of dates.

### Tristan Vosburg

#### Goals

* Add functionality to tokenize and error handle speech input string
* Simple WebSpeechAPI Implementation: Implement WebSpeechAPI into backend

#### Progress & Issues

* 

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* 

### Nicholas Woodley

#### Goals

* Work on Navbar and other buttons on the main page
* Test how tasks interact with button calls with database
* Implement bug report feature

#### Progress & Issues

* This past week went well, as I got all of the goals for the week done. I started on some other aspects of the homepage (mostly the navbar). The design of the sidebar and navbar match our design on figma.
* I ran into some issues with the navbar/sidebar with routing, but that was fixed after some debugging. The database issue mentioned earlier should be fixed, so no other issues.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Finish database calls, make sure sidebar filters tasks correctly
* Work on how API calls get called on frontend
* If time, could update CSS stylesheets to be more compact

### Kai Lindskog-Coffin

#### Goals

* Implement Oauth login data port to MongoDB

#### Progress & Issues

* I have implemented the Oauth porting of the login information from Oauth to MongoDB. Some of my challenges included 
  creating the propper and secure methods. I have also added more documentation into the Living document that describes
  how to operate given user or developer.

#### Next Week's Plans & Goals

* Created schema, routing, and services for possible friends entity
* Test Oauth to MongoDB
